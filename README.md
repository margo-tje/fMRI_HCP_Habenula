## Data used: HCP S1200 Release.
You can downdload this dataset on: https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm

## Habenula segmentation: 
Used V-Net automated habenula segmentation using only T1w scans from Kim, Joo-won, and Junqian Xu. "Automated Human Habenula Segmentation from T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images using V-Net." bioRxiv (2022): 2022-01, see https://github.com/joowon-kim/hb_seg_vnet

Then, resulting habenula seeds were thresholded as in Ely, Benjamin A., et al. "Resting‚Äêstate functional connectivity of the human habenula in healthy individuals: Associations with subclinical depression." Human brain mapping 37.7 (2016): 2369-2384.

   Used script: Segmentationscript_Vnet.sh

## Running CONN
When all seeds and ROIs are achieved, you can run CONN for the fMRI analysis. I adapted this script: https://github.com/alfnie/conn/blob/master/conn_batch_humanconnectomeproject.m

  Used script: conn_ROItoROI_Multivar.m
  Slightly adapted per dataset
  
## Resting state fMRI: 2nd level analysis in R
I combine all output from CONN in 1 excel as input to R for 2nd level analysis.
   Used script: RScript_ROItoROI_300pps-BMI-RestingState_clean.R
   
  *for the exploratory dataset (n=72), the same is used but different input, and BMI * HbA1c instead of BMI + HbA1c.

## Task fMRI: 2nd level analysis in R
  Used script: R_MixedModel_Script_tfMRI_final.R
